# Web Automation Testing Project with Selenium (Java)

Welcome to the Web Automation Testing project using Selenium in Java! This project focuses on automating various web elements and actions on popular websites in our country. The aim is to streamline and enhance the testing process by automating tasks such as clicking, hovering, scrolling, handling iframes, OTPs, tab creation, window manipulation, maximizing, minimizing, and more.

## Project Overview
